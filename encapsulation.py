# Public Members
# Public members are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. 
# These are the default members in Python.

# class Public:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.name = "John"  # Public attribute

#     def display_name(self):
#         print(self.name)  # Public method

# obj = Public()
# obj.display_name()  # Accessible
# print(obj.name)  # Accessible

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Protected members
# Protected members are identified with a single underscore (_). 
# They are meant to be accessed only within the class or its subclasses.

# class Protected:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self._age = 30  # Protected attribute

# class Subclass(Protected):
#     def display_age(self):
#         print(self._age)  # Accessible in subclass

# obj = Subclass()
# obj.display_age()

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Private members
# Private members are identified with a double underscore (__) and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. 
# Python uses name mangling to make private members inaccessible by renaming them internally.

# Note: Pythonâ€™s private and protected members can be accessed outside the class through python name mangling. 

# class Private:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.__salary = 50000  # Private attribute

#     def salary(self):
#         return self.__salary  # Access through public method

# obj = Private()
# print(obj.salary())  # Works
# # print(obj.__salary)  # Raises AttributeError
